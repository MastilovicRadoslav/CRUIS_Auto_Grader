Renewable energy is becoming one of the most important topics in the 21st century. 
Countries around the world are investing heavily in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power plants. 
These energy sources are sustainable, environmentally friendly, and have the potential to replace fossil fuels in the near future.

Solar energy, for example, uses photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity. 
Wind energy uses large turbines placed in windy areas, both onshore and offshore, to produce power. 
Hydroelectric power relies on the movement of water to generate electricity, often through large dams.

Despite their advantages, renewable sources face challenges such as high initial costs, weather dependency, and storage issues. 
However, advancements in battery technology and smart grids are helping to overcome these problems. 
It is essential for governments, businesses, and individuals to support the transition to clean energy for a sustainable future.
